The aim of the `trophic_ecology_mesopelagic` project is to reproduce analysis performed is the paper by Loutrage et al., . 

## Overview

Here is an overview of `trophic_ecology_mesopelagic` content: 

-  [`data/`](https://github.com/lizloutrage/trophic_ecology_mesopelagic/tree/main/data):
contains all raw data required to perform analyses

-  [`R/`](https://github.com/lizloutrage/trophic_ecology_mesopelagic/tree/main/R):
  contains the functions to run the analysis  
  
-  [`_targets`](https://github.com/lizloutrage/trophic_ecology_mesopelagic/tree/main/index.qmd):
  contains the workflow of the analyses

-  [`index.qmd`](https://github.com/lizloutrage/trophic_ecology_mesopelagic/tree/main/index.qmd):
  contains the final report to be knitted

-  [`figures/`](https://github.com/lizloutrage/trophic_ecology_mesopelagic/tree/main/figures):
  contains the figures in high resolution 

## Workflow 
- calculation of the isotopic niches of species at community level (i.e. with all depths grouped together) and calculation of niche overlaps between species 
- Determining trophic guilds using a clustering method, then comparing the depth distribution of species within trophic guilds to determine whether species use depth to segregate. 
- calculation of isotopic diversity indices (Cucherousset & Villéger, 2015)
- comparison of the niche size values for each species with the values obtained under a null model (at random)
- comparison of the sum of niche overlap values within each depth layer with the values obtained under a null model (at random)


## Comment 
- We have used the __targets workflow__ to run the analysis [`_targets`]. To run the analysis run "tar_make()" and to view the workflow run "tar_visnetwork()".
-  The default parameters applied are 10,000 bivariate random samples with a replacement of n = 10, therefore the analysis takes some time to run, you can change these parameters to reduce the analysis time. 
- the si_div function comes from the paper by Cucherousset & Villéger 2015 (DOI: 10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.03.032)
- the functions for comparing the size of the isotopic niche of species and their overlap with null models were inspired by the approach of Suchomel et al. (2022) (DOI: 10.3390/d14080689) and Brind'Amour & Dubois (2013) (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084198)
