The aim of the `trophic_ecology_mesopelagic` project is to study the distribution of isotopic niches in the community of deep pelagic fish (25-1335m depth) sampled on the continental slope of the Bay of Biscay.

## Comment 
- the si_div function comes from the paper by Cucherousset & Vill√©ger 2015 (DOI: 10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.03.032)
- the functions for comparing the size of the isotopic niche of species and their overlap with null models were inspired by the approach of Suchomel et al. (2022) and Brind'Amour & Dubois 2013 (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084198)
