# niche_area_sp: calculates niche size values for each species observed within an assemblage and compares them with the size of a niche derived from a stochastic model (random null model)

# overlap_std: calculates both the observed sum of all species overlaps within an assemblage and compares it with the sum of overlaps derived from a stochastic model (random null model)
